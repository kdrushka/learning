    "#### (b) Two of the types of zooplankton widely found in this database are (1) <i><font color='green'>Chaetognatha</font></i> (a type of planktonic marine worm) and (2) <i><font color='green'>Copepoda</font></i> (a type of planktonic crustacean).  Write code to determine the numbers of samples in the database for each of these types of zooplankton.\n",
    "#### (c)  Using <i><font color='green'>Basemap</font></i> and the data file, make a global plot of the locations of the samples of <i>Chaetognatha</i> (plotted with <font color='red'>red</font> symbols) and <i>Copepoda</i> (plotted with <font color='blue'>blue</font> symbols). \n",
