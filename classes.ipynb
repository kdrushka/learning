    "A *class* is a named conglomoration of information and/or functions---that is, of other Python objects. We can define a class; we can use a class directly; and we can create any number of *instances* of a given class, and use them just as we would any other Python object (which is itself a class or an instance of a class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are something like modules.  Remember, a module is a file with Python code in it.  (More correctly, the module is the object resulting from importing the file.)  That code can provide information, and it can include functions that know about, and work with, that information.  The same is true of a class; but classes are more flexible, because they, and their instances, can be defined and modified as a program is executed, and there can be any number of classes defined in a given module.  More importantly, there is only one copy of a given module, with its associated data, in use in a program at a given time; but there can be many *different* instances of a given class, each with its own specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules and classes (and packages, for that matter) implement Python's \"divide and conquer\" approach to keeping programs writable, readable, and maintainable as the problems they address become increasingly complex.  They break information and functionality down into independent, testable, documentable, resuable chunks, with well-defined inputs and outputs to connect the chunks.\n",
